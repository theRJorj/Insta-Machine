Instagram bot and Data gathering with UI

InstaMachine ver 1.0
by R.Jorj


InstaMachine is a post-oriented Instagram bot which means it is more focused on gathering data and storing it inside the SQLite database.
I made this app solely to put to test my web scraping abilities as a beginner programmer and build up some portfolio, therefore I did not use any python's Instagram library like such as instapy.


Features:
1. Simple, modern, and user-friendly interface. (I created it by Qtpy5)
2. Built-in table view and management.
3. Searching by Tag, Location, Link, and Person.
4. Auto account switch.
5. Follow|Unfollow
6. Like|Unlike
7. Comment both single comments or random.
8. Takes screenshots.
9. Downloads all Images.
10. Reports.
11. Filers Data by:
-Image Recognition(image AI).
-OCR or texts scan in images. (NOTE: You need to have tesseract installed on your pc. as a developer you can add new languages too)
-Particular text on a caption.
-Likes count.
-Date posted.
-Price/Phone
  


Disclaimer:  Please NOTE as I mentioned this is just a personal project and I do not encourage anyone to use this app against Instagram's terms of use. if your account gets banned due to using this app, I am not responsible. use it at your own risk.



In the end, anyone is welcome to contribute to this app. there is a lot of room for improvements. Please check my github for my other projects.
